        <p> I was born and raised here in Atlanta, Georgia. Oddly enough I haven't visited many popular places here in Atlanta. I'm 'hood' like people think, it's just my last name. 
         I like to complete a variety of puzzles: sudoku, crossword, etc.   I had to have a surgery in 2017 to remove 2 egg sized tumors and my ovary. Three months later I got pregnant. I'm a self taught hair stylist and I can't wait to make a website for my business!
